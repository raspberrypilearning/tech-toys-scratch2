## Powering up your helicopter

Let's code your helicopter to start up when your laptop is clicked.

--- task ---

Let's start by broadcasting a `start`{:class="blockevents"} message when the laptop is clicked. You'll need to create a `new message` called `start`.

![laptop sprite](images/laptop-sprite.png)

```blocks
when this sprite clicked
play sound [computer beeps1 v]
broadcast [start v]
```

This code broadcasts a message to all other sprites. If you test this code, you'll see that nothing happens yet! This is because you've not coded the helicopter to respond to the message.

--- task ---

Click on your helicopter sprite and add a `When I receive`{:class="blockevents"} block. Any code attached to this block will be run when it receives the 'start' message from the laptop.

```blocks
when I receive [start v]
```

If you click your helicopter's 'Costumes' tab, you'll notice that it has 2 costumes with slightly different propellers.

You can use the 2 costumes to animate the helicopter. Add this code, so that the helicopter changes costumes forever once it receives the 'start' message.

```blocks
when I receive [start v]
+forever
next costume
end
```

Test your code by clicking your laptop sprite. Does your helicopter's propeller animate?
